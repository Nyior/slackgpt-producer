## What is Django Rest CLI ?
Slack is where the work happens â€“ it is where the content team deliberates on potential articles or Youtube video concepts, while the development team chooses the technology and architecture to adopt.

Now, picture ChatGPT joining these daily discussions that occur on Slack - this is exactly what SlackGPT does for you :)

## Getting Started
This project has two services - this repo is just one of two services. You can find the consumer [here](https://github.com/Nyior/slackgpt-consumer).

Follow [this tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/p/38d6d560-69b3-4379-b653-ce6dd780d915/) to setup, run both services, and eventually test the bot.
